# Advanced design patterns in Angular development

This repos contains the source code of my [eastcode session](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/eastcode-sessions/events/251475451/). 
The corresponding slides can be found [here](https://speakerdeck.com/duffleit/advanced-angular-design-patterns).
  
The project is based on Angular 6 and was created with the angular cli.  
Feel free to run it locally with `npm install && npm run start` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see it in action.
